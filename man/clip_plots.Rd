\item{n_core}{number of cores to use in clipping}

\item{dir_dtm}{in case path to dtms has changed from lasR_project}

\description{
clip plots or polygons form lidar - requires that one first make a project using lasR_project which
 includes both lidar and dtms
}
\details{
There are three ways to provide the input shapes to this function - either as a
 list of plot ids, coordinates and plot diameters (4 column data.frame), as a list of vertices
 organized by plot_id (3 column data.frame), or as a polygon shapefile (path to shapefile) inwich case
 the plot id field must be specified "id_field_plots".
